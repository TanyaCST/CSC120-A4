Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    I feel like it's vague at the beginning when you are trying to define whether the attributes are public or private and the hint really helps me to define which attribute should be public and which attribute should be private. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Some questions arose while doing the homework;
    1. What does 'this' do there? how does it functions?
    
    Methods and constructors work, but there is one thing I'm confused is that there is a warning that the value of Passenger.name is not used. Why? we have already matched this.name with name.
